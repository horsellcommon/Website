        <p>Ray Gun, arguably the Universe's best photographer according to the inhabitants of Proxima Centauri, has had a breadth of experience capturing time's greatest moments both big and small; from the Big Bang itself to more lesser-known events such as the evaporation of Saturn's rings and a new bypass through Neptune. Starting out as a sports editor for regional solar-system newspaper <em>Where Exactly Is The Kuiper Belt Times</em>, Gun quickly made a name for himself as the newspaper's premier journalisto. Soon after his first major story broke: "<em>Long Jump Finalist Accidentally Eradicates Type 0 Civilisation</em>", Gun decided that his forte was in photography rather than prose and so left his job at <em>WEITKBT</em> to pursue larger endeavours outside of the Solar System.</p>

        <center><h3>New Post: A Taqueria on The Moon</h3></center>
        <center><p>Recently, I visited Tycho as a quick stop off to recuperate before heading back to see family and friends on Earth. As I made my way down the crater to visit one of my favourite bars in the Solar System (<em>The Higgs-Bladdered</em>), I noticed a new build near the flats that turned out to be a new taqueria. As I ventured in to see what all the fuss is about I was <b>ACCOSTED</b> by one of the servers who asked if I wanted a seat. I thought, I won't stand for any of this nonsense and promptly told them that I preferred to stand when I eat (as you all know, my humble readers). Anyway, to cut a long story short the food was dismal and the service shocking, I'd rather spend my time drinking salt water on Europa. Four stars out of five.</p></center>

        <center><h3>New Post: POCKET DIMENSIONS - Should they be taxed?</h3></center>
        <center><p>The last pocket dimension I entered was a creation by advertising megacorporation <em>CoolAds</em> and I've gotta say, I had the time of my life. Not only did they have jacuzzis with decentralised physics where the water felt like batteries but the serviettes were all shaped like swans. A thought crossed my mind though, and that thought was: How much money are these corporate swines raking in from all these dimension timeshares they're peddling to the average Joe? I asked around while I floated in my infinite jacuzzi and found that the number was absolutely heinous. On average, these company-owned pocket dimensions net a profit of around 2.5e13 credits PER HOUR. The sway that a custom-physics playground has over people must be astronomical if they're pulling in this kind of cash. MY OPINION is that we should tax these corporate hellscapes so that the 1% can see some of the profit too.</p></center>

        <center><h3>New Post: Ten Inch Man Found Living Inside Bin in Shropshire</h3></center>
        <center><p>A man around the height of ten inches has been found living inside a bin in Shropshire. Inside, investigators found a three piece suite and a fully functioning kitchen with adequate plumbing separated by partition walls.
            <br><br>
        <q>We had to evict him, as the inadequate electrical wiring proved to be a fire hazard.</q>
        <blockquote>- Constable Clap Flaherty</blockquote>
        <br>
        <br>
        I raced to the scene to interview the now-destitute man and quickly found out that the bin-lined trespasser was not a man at all, but rather a traveller from a far off exoplanet in the Andromeda Galaxy. Another exclusive catch by Ray Gun, BA (Hons). Turns out the extraterrestrial visitor preferred to live in bins, as that is the custom of his people. I calmly asked the traveller what he would like to tell humanity but then somehow his English became garbled and broken, I assume that he was speaking in code or that his translator was broken. He stated these three things to me:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Please leave me alone, I've told you everything.</li>
            <br>
            <li>You're breaking it, get your foot off the settee.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Look what you've done.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        (My first assumption was that he was picking up some sort of transmission but if any reader could attempt to figure out what was meant by this I would love to hear from you.)
