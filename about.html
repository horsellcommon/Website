        <p>Ray Gun has been the be all and end all of everything photojournalism since time immemorial. Born in sleepy Christchurch, Olympus Mons on Mars, Ray studied cinematography and journalism at the revered Marsbridge University, before going on to work at now-defunct system-wide newspaper <b><em>Where Exactly Is The Kuiper Belt Times</em></b>. After his breakthrough piece, "<em>Long Jump Finalist Accidentally Eradicates Type 0 Civilisation</em>", broke all Solar System records for "Most Despised Editorial", Ray Gun decided that his destiny lay elsewhere, beyond the Solar System and so, he made his way beyond to work for an intergalactic tabloid rag called <b><em>The Quasar</em></b>. Travelling with little more than a bindle of designer clothing, his trusty Quigon 35mm camera, a portable fridge-freezer, four-hundred million in credits, and a state-of-the-art supership from Lambrettini, he made his way across the Universe, exploring each and every planet along the way. </p>

         After six-weeks of living on the poverty line, Ray finally made it to The Quasar's headquarters located in and around the Galactic Center. It was here that Ray created some of his best works, some of which are referenced to on the home page.

        <p>The work of Ray Gun has been featured in many noteworthy publications and editorials, and even some academic work by renowned scholars, one title of which was <em>Hacks and Frauds: An Overview</em> by the famed academic Talbot Bierstein. Gun's images were among the first to show the Galaxy the horrendous bureaucratic nightmare that was the <em>Pan-Constellatory Economic Union</em>, may they rest in peace. Since that fated piece that caused the break-up and subsequent annihilation of forty two planets, Ray has gone on to produce unforgettable images across the Galaxy and various pocket dimensions. Gun's body of work spans conflicts such as <b>The Great Knackering of the Tannhäuser Gate</b>, cosmic protests like <b>The Flattening of Orion</b> (Some of you may remember this one as the piece that involved Ray being pelted by eggs thrown by angry litigators), and such groundbreaking pieces that have no definition such as <b>An Interview With Time: My Infinite Life</b>.

        Gun has been gifted some of the most prestigious awards in the industry, including the NASA Misinformation Gold Medal, Galactic Press Photographers Award, and an unprecedented first prize for Most Useless Contraption, awarded to Ray for his device that takes a photograph of the inside of a camera. His most recent acquisition, however, was an award from the Societies of The Virgo Cluster for Best Smile In The Galaxy.

        Ray Gun founded his charity, Help Ray Buy A New Spaceship in 2167. The mission of RAYBANS, a for-profit, is to help local economies across the Galaxy that Ray has a stake in.
